# covid_supreporting_Brasil
Investigating whether there has been sub-reporting in Covid-19 deaths in Brasil. This is done via comparing expected death numbers with actual death numbers for 2020. First, the analysis is done for the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Later, I hope to do the same analysis for Brazil as a whole.
